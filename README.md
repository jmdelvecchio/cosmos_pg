forward model of cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in periglacial (and other!) settings

"BMC" files are scripts created for this study. "BMC_BMS01..." is the script for the forward model to run to create figures and get answers. 
"BMC_production..." is a function that calculates total annual nuclide production using the Balco 2017 method https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871101416301649

"BMS01_Sample_Data" is the measured data from the core, imported and plotted

"ERA40.mat", "ERA40atm.m", "P_mu_total_alpha1.m", "interpLsp.m", "lat_to_Rc.m" and "stone2000.m" are the scripts from Balco 2017 that are needed to run the production scripts. 

Therefore you need the Balco scripts in the same directory as the production script, and the production script in the same directory as the forward model. 

The Basics of the Forward Model.
